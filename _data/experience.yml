    <p>As an intern for Tata Elxsi, I was tasked with <b>creating an API to perform object detection in identifying humans from video footage and estimating their distance</b>. One of the 
    many proposed applications for the API was to enforce <i>Social Distancing</i> protocols to assist clients better ensure safe working conditions. The API was packaged into a <u>Docker container</u> to 
    maintain stability and ease of sharing.

    <p>As an intern in my 2<sup>nd</sup> year, I worked on a <b>NLP based
    project</b> which focused on the <b>Pashto</b> and <b>Urdu</b> languages.  In
    particular, working with Pashto was quite a challenge as there was
    very small footprint of data available for train/test and yet the
    model had to be built which had to deliver a high level of accuracy, easy
    for inferencing and also be language agnostic to minimise language specific rebuilds of the model.</p>
    <p> Additionally, I worked on other project to evaluate models in Tensorflow.js for deployment. I was also given
    the task to help set up the on-site GPU server for ssh use.</p>

    <p>As part of a team of student researcher under the <b>Samsung PRISM</b> program, I worked on <b>Online Handwritting 
    Recognition</b> in <b>Bengali</b> and <b>Tamil</b>. The <i>dataset</i> was collected by us on campus and comprised of 1300 
    Handwritting samples. The data was in the form of <b>XML Files</b> with <b>(x,y,t)</b> information.</p>
    <p> The model we chose to use was an <b>attention based LSTM</b> to learn more information. This model was combined with a 
    <b>pre-trained language model - BERT</b> to improve the accuracy of our predictions. <i>currently working on testing and 
    modifying the model architecture.
